        var str1 = `Cloud Native Computing: Cloud native computing is an approach in software development that utilizes cloud computing to its fullest due to its use of an open source software stack to deploy applications as microservices.
Typically, cloud native applications are built as a set of microservices that run in Docker containers, orchestrated in Kubernetes and managed and deployed using DevOps and Git Ops workflows.
The advantage of using Docker containers is the ability to package all software needed to execute into one executable package. The container runs in a virtualized environment, which isolates the contained application from its environment.`
